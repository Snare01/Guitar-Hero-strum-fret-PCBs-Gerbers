# Guitar Hero strum/fret PCBs
 Gerber files to order for guitar hero pico mechanical mods

THE STRUM PCB SUPPORTS LP/KRAMER/SG/XP/WT/BH/GH5 V2 TESTED ON LP, GH5, GHWT, XP.
Frets are tested on LP only
LED FRETS ARE THERE FOR USE WITH GP3,GP6,VBUS and GND ON THE PI PICO (follow Sanjay900's guide following APA102 style LED's 
THE LEDS ARE SK9822-EC20 and has not been tested. Again DOUBLE CHECK MEASUREMENTS via KiCad before using this
for the LED frets you need to use the PnP and BOM file in your supplier, (mine JLCPCB) and that will solder them for you since they are difficult otherwise 

THE EXP VERSION OF THE PCB HAS DIFFERENT HOLE TOLERANCES, PLACEMENT, LED SUPPORT AND A ROUNDED PCB, ALTHOUGH PRETTIER TO LOOK AT THERE MIGHT BE ISSUES WITH TOLERANCES BEING TOO TIGHT. 
IF YOU ARE FINE WITH TAKING A RISK FOR A PCB WITH MORE FEATURES THEN ITS HERE FOR EVERYONE BUT I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY TESTED IT. DOUBLE CHECK ALL MEASUREMENTS via KiCad. 

Just a hobbyist who thought they could do this for cheaper, not many openly available PCB's so i thought id put this out there.
download Kicad to verify measurements and or ask me for them

Tolerances were made with JLCPCB in mind as a manufacture

feel free to msg for design changes, i dont have every guitar this supports so it may be off on some measurements
if you own a guitar and a pair of calipers be sure to double check before ordering
