# Guitar Hero strum/fret PCBs
 Gerber files to order for guitar hero pico mechanical mods

THE STRUM PCB HAS BEEN TESTED ON WII LP, GH5, WT, BH, XP, Untested on KRAMER AND SG but should be fine 
USE STRUM V2, V1 has spacing issues towards the Start select pads
Frets are tested on LP only

Just a hobbyist who thought they could do this for cheaper, not many openly available PCB's so i thought id put this out there.
download Kicad to verify measurements and or ask me for them

Use Kailh Choc V1's for frets and Kailh Box for the strum
All pad spacing (except tilt) is 2.54mm center to center if you want to use JST connectors for quick disconnects
Pico clones work

Tolerances were made with JLCPCB in mind as a manufacture

feel free to msg for design changes, i dont have every guitar this supports so it may be off on some measurements
if you own a guitar and a pair of calipers be sure to double check before ordering
